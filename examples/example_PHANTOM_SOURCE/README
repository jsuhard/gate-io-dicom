Some GATE Macro examples about sources and phantoms :

1)

"Analytical_Phantom/"
- "Derenzo.mac"
- "NEMA_IEC_2001.mac"
- "Cylinder.mac"

2)

"Analytical_Source/"
- "Single_Gamma.mac"
- "Two_Gamma_backtoback.mac"
- "Fast_Production_F18_O15_C11.mac"
- "RadioActive_Isotope.mac"

3)

"Voxelized_Phantom_Source/"

Complete simulation description about How To Use the new voxelized approach for imaging applications. In GATE v7.0, this new approach is common for both imaging and RT applications.
Users need to execute the mainMacro.mac file to start the complete example.

The list of macro files which are involved in this example is the following:

- mainMacro.mac
- MoveVisu.mac
- VoxelizedPhantom.mac
- VoxelizedSource.mac
- MoveVisu.mac
- Verbose.mac

The phantom used in this application (Interfile Format)

- raw data:    brain_phantom.i33
- Header file: brain_phantom.h33

And the associated ASCII files to convert phantom voxel values in material properties and activity values:

- range_atten_brain.dat
- activity_range_brain.dat
