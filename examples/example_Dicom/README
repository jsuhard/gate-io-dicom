#### Description:

These macros show how to read DICOM CT and write DICOM RT DOSE.
They have only a demonstration purpose of these cited functions and do not use realistic physics for fast results.
Each macro represents a patient composed only of Tungsten in a world of Vacuum.
Thus, the dose is only deposited on the patient.

#### How to use:

$ Gate main_head_hfs.mac
$ Gate main_mouse_ffs.mac
...

#### How to edit:

Commons macros are in the "mac" folder.
Configuration can be edited in the mac/config.mac file, it defines a lot of variables used in the four simulations.
Simulation speed (and thus accuracy) is controlled by the NUMBER_OF_PRIMARIES variable.

#### Outputs:

Each simulation produces :
* one dose distribution of the entire CT,
* one or two smallest dose distribution for showing spatial orientation according to original CT.
